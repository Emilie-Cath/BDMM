This is the repository of codes and dataset used for the BDMM article.

Here you can find different folders.
The mixing models folder contains the source codes for dynamic mixing model ans Bayesian dynamic mixing model (R and stan codes).
The model runs folder contains the R codes used to run the mixing models on different dataset.
You can use these code as examples on how to implement BDMM on dataset
The dataset folder contains the excel files with the two dataset used in this study coming from
